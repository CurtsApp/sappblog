# Active Involvement
Performances that are viewed in person, thinks like theatre, musicals, symphonies, and sporting events.

## SoCal HEMA - March 2025
My second HEMA tournament. Carpooled with 2 of my clubmates and stayed in an AirBnB for a total of 8 of us, it was a blast! I qualified for the elimination bracket in open longsword. I also fought in an experimental format for 3v3 team single stick. We had fun. There was some drama with one tackling and other guy and getting removed from the event.

## Archery Javillina Hunting - Jan 2025
Went with Matt and Dad for a 2 day hunt, saw tons of pigs. Ran around. Had a great time.

## Fright Fight HEMA - Oct 2024
