# Performances
Performances that are viewed in person, thinks like theatre, musicals, symphonies, and sporting events.

## Phoenix Symphony - Feb 2025
Bonecos de Olinda by Clarice Assad (1978)
Symphonie espagnole, op 21 by Edouard Lalo feature Richard Lin on Violin
La valse by Maurice Ravel
Suite No 2 from Pahnis et Chloe by Maurice Ravel

The star of this performance was the soloist Richard Lin, he was amazing! He absolutely shredded and came back for an encore solo performance of an arrangement of a pop song Katie and I couldn't quite place that incorporated lots of percussive and unique sounds all from his violin. It was awesome! I generally preferred the more modern Bonecos de Olinda over the Ravel pieces but they were all very good to listen too.

## Sound of Music - 2023
Very good, fun songs. Good vibes. Very memorable use of Swastika display. I would recommend.

## Tosca - 2023
Opera that I'm not certain what it was about. Something todo with an escaped prisoner who's friend is a really good painter. The painter dies to the oppressive government so then his girlfriend kills herself at the end. It was sad and the music was okay at best. I would not recommend.
