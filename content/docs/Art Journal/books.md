## Amusing Ourselves to Death - Jan 2025
A technical analysis of how society is moving towards the dystopia predicted in Brave New World. Many of the points made in the book resonated with me. I would recommend this, but only if you've read Brave New World first. The general point was that individual freedoms are taken away not from an oppressive government but by inundating our lives with pleasures and distractions that make normal discourse hard to parse. One of the big turning points of this was TV broadcasts influenced how politicians behaved and changed a campaign from something that won people over with reason and information but into a show where candidates put on a pageant for their constituents.
