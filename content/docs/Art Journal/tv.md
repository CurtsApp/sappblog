# TV Shows & Movies
TV shows and movies, no matter the genre or platform.

## Arcane - December 2024
A show about class struggle, fantastical creations, and love. The animation style for this show is truly unique and awesome. The music is also fantastic. I highly recommend this show to everyone except children, it can be rather dark and gritty at times.

## Rick and Morty - 2023
An animated sci-fi show about the a kid and his crazy, selfish, alcoholic, scientist grandpa getting into trouble. It is comedic but sometimes dark. This show is not meant for children.

## Severance

## Frozen

## Encanto

## The Lobster
