# Video Games
Video games, no matter the genre or platform.

## Marvel Rivals - Feb 2025
A fun hero shooter with classic comic book characters. It's a fun game, especially with friends. Reminds me of Overwatch.

## Cyberpunk 2077 - January 2025
A single player RPG placed in a sci-fi capitalist dystopia where corporation call the shots and you do your best to survive on the scraps. Everyone has varying levels of cybernetic augmentations and you end up getting framed for murder after accidentally getting Johnny Silverhand's personality engram fused into your brain. Your goal is to find a way to prevent Johnny's engram from taking over your body. The best part was the general environment of the game was very cool and evocative. The game-play was straight forward and the characters were predictable in a satisfying way. I would recommend this game.
