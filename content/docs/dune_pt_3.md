# Dune Part 3 - Regicide

## Purpose
Dune Part 3 - Regicide's purpose is to create a fun environment where we can get together, laugh, and stretch our imagination through the medium of collaborative story telling. The characters you take on have a history, they expressed themes and ideas in Frank Herber's original book Dune, those ideas were altered to fit the movie, I have now taken those ideas and tweaked them to fit a specific narrative direction for this evening, and finally the ideas are handed off to you. Please add, embellish, and alter your character as we play to put your personal flare into our story.

{{< hint warning >}}
Changes to your character should not alter events that took place in the Dune films, that would invalidate the group's shared background information. They should supplement the existing character information, ideally fleshing out details the movie did not cover in depth.
{{< /hint >}}

## Background
Our story takes place the moment the Dune part 2 movie ends, Paul has announced his marriage to Princess Irulan to cement his claim as the new, non-hereditary, Padisha Emperor of the Landsraad and is hosting a coronation dinner for any nobility that will attend. 

## How to play the game
Show up to mom's house on April 21st at 5:00 PM dressed in formal attire. Everyone will pick a character and be given an envelope that contains additional *secret* character details. Those *secret* details will tell you about your character's relationships with the other coronation attendees as well as what your objective is for the game. In additional to your *secret* objective, Paul Atreides has been found dead, leaving a power vacuum to be filled. Nearly everyone at the coronation has a potential motivation to want Paul dead, so his murder is no surprise but who will be the new Padisha emperor? No reason to waste a good coronation feast, the Landsraad are going to elect a new emperor before the night is out.

Each leader of a House of the Landsraad will get a vote, when each voting character has committed to a vote (done by secret ballot) the game is over and everyone will check to see if they accomplished their *secret* objective. Most characters objectives will be related to having themselves or a certain person be crowned as the new Padisha emperor.

### How do I influence people's votes?
You will be roleplaying as your character to convince the other coronation attendees why their interests align with yours. This is the world of Dune, you will have to put on your politics hat and make some backroom deals. In addition to your personal cunning, you will also have **influence** you can trade throughout the night and use to trigger events. Your **influence** is tracked using colored tokens that correspond to the faction the influence is for. You may trade your influence with other attendees at any time by giving them any tokens of any combination in exchange for an agreed upon amount of any tokens they have. 

{{< hint warning >}}
You may also exchange **influence** for favors and actions that do not include the other party giving you **influence** directly. Any influence exchanged for future favors is not required to be taken. However, know that doing so will hurt your reputation for future deals so it is recommended to use this option with caution.

**Example**

After chatting with Chani, Shaddam IV learns that one of Chani's goals is to ensure that Princess Irulan ends the night destitute. Though Shaddam can not take Princess Irulan's **influence** away directly, he offers to lend Chani a battalion of Sardaukar in exchange for a shipment of Spice. Chani agrees to exchange one of her spice **influence** tokens for two of Shaddam IV's House Corrino **influence** tokens. Shaddam IV thinks this is a good deal because he knows Guild Navigator Edric is gathering as much spice as possible and Shaddam IV plans to bribe Edric to decrease cost of House Corrino actions. Chani thinks this is a good deal because her *secret* character information tells her that if she ends the night with more House Corrino **influence** than Princess Irulan then Chani can have Princess Irulan exiled.

To help keep the immersive roleplay it is best to negotiation **influence** transactions using in universe objects that your character would reasonably have access to. In this instance, Shaddam IV and Chani were bartering battalions of Sardukar and Spice even though the transaction is mechanically represented using **influence** tokens. Have fun with what your items/service you are offering while trying to keep them realistic to things your character has access to.

### Types of Influence tokens
| Influence | Color | Represents |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| House Atreides   | Green   | Fremen warriors, access to spice fields, control of water on Arakkis   |

### Influence Actions
At any time throughout the coronation influence may be given to the game master to trigger an event to happen.  Some characters have unique events they can trigger that are specified in their *secret* details. Every character my use their influence to perform the following actions:

- Destroy the Spice fields with the Atreides family atomics: Expend 9 Atreides **influence** then remove all Spice tokens from the game regardless of who owns them. No more Spice may be created.
- Sardukar extortion: Expend 3 Corrino **influence** then steal 2 influence from another character, that character gains 1 House Corrino influence.
- Initiate a Sardaukar coop: Expend 9 Corrino **influence** then steal every Corrino **influence** from another character.
- Reveal the location of a Shai-Hulud breeding pit: Expend 3 Atreides **influence** then everyone, except 3 characters of your choice, gain 1 Spice. The maximum number of Spice must be distributed, you may select yourself.
- Leverage the Spice: Exchange 2 Spice for 1 of any other type of **influence**.
- Create a minor house coalition: Expend 3 Minor House **influence**, gain a vote for the new Padisha emperor. The coalition is with an unlisted minor house, you will select their vote during the final election, though you may purchase the coalition before voting time if you are concerned about holding onto the raw **influence**.
{{< hint info >}}
It is not advisable to trigger an event just because you have the correct **influence**, consider how the threat of triggering an event might be even more beneficial or can you get even more value by trading this **influence** to someone else before spending your **influence** for an event.
