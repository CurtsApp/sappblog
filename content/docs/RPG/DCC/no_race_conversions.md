# Removing Race as Class

The idea of all dwarves wielding melee weapons and a shield or all elves casting spells does not translate well to the Adigash universe. For setting constancy, the classes of DCC will be modified to be race agnostic.

All classes can have their **Alignment** section ignored.

All classes gain the ability to speak their native language, race specific languages as part of the class are removed. For example, a Kobold with the "Dwarf (Hardened Fighter)" class would speak Draconic and Common, not Dwarfish.

## Dwarf ( Hardened Fighter )

You are a warrior with a specific domain of expertise, you may have lived in the same area for a while or been born from the natural environment. This knowledge has been retained through your natural affinity for self preservation.

Remove the following sections, they can be ignored, no replacement is needed:

- **Infravision**: A dwarf can see in the dark up to 60’.
- **Slow**: A dwarf has a base movement speed of 20’, as opposed to 30’ for humans

The **Underground Skills** section is replaced with the following:

**Favorable Terrain**: Choose a type of terrain, for example: underground, urban, above ground wilderness, Faewild, Hell, or the Astral Sea, your experience in this area makes you familiar with it's natural and artificial architecture. When in your favored terrain, you receive a bonus to detect traps, slanting passages, shifting walls, and other new construction equal to their class level. Additionally, you have an innate knowledge of where treasure would be hidden away within this terrain.

## Elf ( Eldritch Knight )

You are a fighter with assistance from otherworldly creatures. This allows your martial training to be enhanced with spell casting and additional powers granted by your patron.

Remove the following sections, they can be ignored, no replacement is needed:
- **Weapon training**: Because of their sensitivity to iron (as explained below), elf characters are trained from an early age with mithril weapons. Before they depart on a life of adventure, they have acquired mithril equipment. At 1st level, an elf character may purchase one piece of armor and one weapon that are manufactured of mithril at no additional cost. Mithril armor weighs slightly less than iron or steel armor of the same type and can be worn by the elf without the pain normally associated with metal armors.
- **Infravision**: An elf can see in the dark up to 60’.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Elves are extremely sensitive to the touch of iron. Direct contact over prolonged periods causes a burning sensation, and exposure at close distances makes them comfortable. An elf may not wear iron armor or bear the touch of iron weapons for extended periods. Prolonged contact with iron causes 1 hp of damage per day of direct contact.
 
Rename the following sections:\
**Immunities** -> **Patron Power (Immunities)**\
**Heightened Senses** -> **Patron Power (Heightened Senses)**\
**Luck** -> **Patron Power (Luck)**

## Halfling ( Swashbuckler )

You always finds yourself in the right place at the right time. You may use this skill however you see fit. The one constant you know is everyone's luck will run out if it's pushed too far.

Remove the following sections, they can be ignored, no replacement is needed:
- **Infravision**: Halflings dwell in pleasant homes carved from the sod beneath hills. As such, halflings can see in the dark up to 30’.
- **Small size**: Halflings are 2 to 4 feet tall, and the stoutest among them weighs no more than 70 pounds. This small size allows them to crawl into narrow passages and through tiny holes
- **Slow**: A halfling has a base movement speed of 20’, as opposed to 30’ for humans
